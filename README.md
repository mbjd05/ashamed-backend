# A.S.H.A.M.E.D.: A Smart Home Aggregated MEasurements Dashboard
The backend repository for the A.S.H.A.M.E.D. project.

## Project goal
This backend aims to be an MQTT broker and client for use with Zigbee2MQTT, as well as a measurents database manager, and a REST-API for interaction via frontend.

## Run locally
You can of course clone the repo, or you can run the docker image from 'packages'. This gets generated by the CI/CD pipeline (github actions), and is always up to date with main.

### Running the Docker image
1. If you're not yet logged in, authenticate with github container registry.
    ```pwsh
    echo "YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" | docker login ghcr.io -u YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME --password-stdin
   ```
2. If you do not yet have one, generate a self-signed development SSL certificate and trust it (pwsh)
    ```pwsh
    dotnet dev-certs https -ep $HOME\.aspnet\https\aspnetapp.pfx -p YOUR_CERT_PASSWORD ; dotnet dev-certs https --trust
   ```
4. pull and run the image.
   ```pwsh
    docker run --pull always --rm -it -p 443:443 -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=/https/aspnetapp.pfx -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password="YOUR_CERT_PASSWORD" -v $HOME\.aspnet\https:/https/ ghcr.io/mbjd05/ashamed-backend:latest
   ```
